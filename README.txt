   DeckOfCards is a project that I have worked on off and on for over
a year before putting it on github.  It is a Servlet that models the
dealing of a normal playing cards and sends back a web page using CSS
to display the cards with three graphic files for the Jack, Queen and
King.

   It also was designed with the intent of being used with decks with
extra or different cards.

   Currently it just deals cards, it does not play a game.  I do not
plan to put the logic for a game within these classes.  But writing
the rules for a game in a new class.  That way these classes can
be used to support many games.

   It case your are wondering the cards are stored in a hidden input
field, thus the server does not have to maintain a cookie or a session.
